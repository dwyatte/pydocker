Pydocker
=========

.. note::  Pydocker is in alpha and under active development.

**Release:** v\ |version| ---
**Quick Links:** `Source <https://github.com/square/pydocker>`_ | `Issues <https://github.com/square/pydocker/issues>`_ | `Get Started <get-started.html>`_

This goal of **pydocker** is to make it seamless to work on a docker
container on your laptop like you would with your normal environment.
This means it handles passing all of your credentials (SSH key, Google,
etc) and mounting a directory of your choosing from the host machine to
the container, and sets up port forwarding so that you can still use
notebooks. It supports local images, Google Container Repository, or
anywhere docker can pull from.
