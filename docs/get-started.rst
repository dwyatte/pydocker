===========
Get Started
===========




**(Note: These instructions currently  OSX specifix because of brew but does work on other OSes.)**

Before you install the library there are some minimal environment setup
steps.

Docker setup
=============

Install and start Docker:

::

    brew cask install docker
    open /Applications/Docker.app

Build Example Image
--------------------




**Dockerfile**

.. code:: dockerfile

    FROM google/cloud-sdk:slim
    RUN pip install jupyterlab notebook pandas
    RUN  /bin/echo -e '#!/bin/bash\njupyter notebook --notebook-dir="/" --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root --NotebookApp.token=""' > /usr/bin/notebook && \
        chmod +x /usr/bin/notebook && \
         /bin/echo -e '#!/bin/bash\njupyter lab --notebook-dir="/" --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root --NotebookApp.token=""' > /usr/bin/lab && \
        chmod +x /usr/bin/lab
    WORKDIR /current
    CMD notebook

This Dockerfile uses the current directory as the workspace, and will
look for all files there and the build command,
``docker build -t notebook -f Dockerfile .``, will create a local docker
image called **Notebook**, which uses the *google/cloud-sdk* as a base
image. The Dockerfile also then makes a couple of small scripts to make
it easier to launch notebooks or jupyterlab.

Install pydocker
=================

::

    pip install sq-pydocker

Setup ssh for pydocker
--------------

::

    pydocker init

This will copy your ssh keys, and create a new config based on your main
square config, but modified because of running in a docker container.
This only needs to be run the first time.


Using pydocker
==============

::

    Usage: pydocker [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

    Options:
      -v, --verbose
      --help         Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      agent
      init
      launch
      status

Start ssh-agent container
-------------------------

If you need to have the ability to ssh into machines you can start an
ssh-agent in a container with:

.. code:: python

    pydocker agent

This will add keys copied with the ``init`` command without passwords
automatically, or print the command you need to run to add password
protected keys. This ``ssh-agent`` container will then be connected to
all other containers, so you don't need to keep entering your key
password. The makes it more secure by not storing any credentials in the
Image. This container can be restarted when needed, if you run
``pydocker agent`` it will delete the container, and make a new one.

Launch
------

::

    Options:
        -i, --image TEXT        Docker image
        -n, --name TEXT         container name
        -d, --working-dir TEXT  host directory to mount
        -p, --port INTEGER      Host port to be connected to container port 8888
        -l, --no-logs           disable streaming of container logs
        --gcloud / --no-gcloud  include gcloud credentials
        -c, --command TEXT      command which is passed to container
        -r, --rm                enable auto-removal of the container on daemon side
                                when the containerâ€™s process exits
        --help                  Show this message and exit.

This command launches the notebook (which we built above) and forwards
internal port 8888 to the laptops port 9000 and creates a container
named test. In addition the host's current folder ``.`` is mounted in
the **working\_dir** folder. This gives the container access to the host
filesystem. After running the command you can go to ``localhost:9000``
in your browser.

::

    pydocker launch --image notebook --name test --working-dir . --port 9000 --no-gcloud

Remote images also work:

::

    pydocker launch --image jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest --name example --working-dir . --port 9000 --no-gcloud

Will pull the remote image down first. You can still do
``docker pull IMAGE`` and pydocker will use the already downloaded
image.

Google Cloud Setup (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is only required if you are going to be using Google Cloud. If you
already have gcloud installed, update by running
``gcloud components update``. If you have not setup Google Cloud
already, begin by installing Google Cloud.

1. Download the
   (archive)(https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-mac-os-x) and
   unpack it (only do the "Before you begin" section).

2. Navigate to the folder containing ``google-cloud-sdk`` and run

   .. code:: bash

       ./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh

3. Set your gcloud account and project.

   .. code:: bash

       gcloud auth login
       gcloud config set account ${USER}@DOMAIN.com
       gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT
       gcloud auth application-default login

4. Now generate your ssh credentials by running:

   .. code:: bash

       gcloud compute ssh --zone "us-central1-a" "RUNNING_VM"

Status Server
-------------

.. code:: bash

    pydocker status

This will open a status server which will show a page with information
about all local containers. This includes a link to clink into any with
open port forwarding.
